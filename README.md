By Tina Danielsson and Per Jonsson

Decryption Lab in C++ (11)

This lab was given as a Data Structures and Algorithms assignment at Link√∂ping university in 2013.

Our solution consists of the code in <decrypt.cc> . Given an encrypted password it will spit out possible candidates given a set of tables (not included in this package).

The method being used is also known as "Subset Sum".
